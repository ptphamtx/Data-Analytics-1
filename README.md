## Lean Six Sigma
Case: A college IT Help Desk supports students and staff. Many users complain that their tickets (technical issues) take too long to be resolved. The goal is to reduce average ticket resolution time while keeping service quality high.

---

## Step 1: Define

- **Problem Statement:** The average IT ticket resolution time is 5 days, which is longer than the acceptable 2-day standard.  
- **Goal:** Reduce the average ticket resolution time to 2 days within 6 months.  
- **Scope:** Focus only on password reset, email access, and software installation tickets (80% of all requests).  
- **Team:** Help Desk Manager, IT Technician, Lean Six Sigma Green Belt student.  

---

## Step 2: Measure

### Baseline Data Collected
- Current average resolution time: 5 days  
- Ticket backlog: 120 open tickets at any time  
- Percentage of tickets resolved within 2 days: 20%  

### Tools Used
- Process Map (SIPOC) of ticket handling flow  
- Excel pivot tables to track resolution times  
- Control chart showing variability in ticket resolution  

---

## Step 3: Analyze

### Findings
- 40% of delays happen because tickets are assigned manually to technicians (sometimes wrong assignment).  
- 30% of delays are due to waiting for software installation approval.  
- Password reset tickets (which should be solved in less than 1 hour) are mixed with bigger issues, creating bottlenecks.  

---

## Step 4: Improve

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Automation:** Password reset tickets handled automatically through self-service.  
2. **Categorization:** Use a triage system to categorize tickets (low, medium, high priority).  
3. **Standard Approval:** Pre-approved list for common software, eliminating manager sign-off delays.  

### Pilot Results
- Average resolution time reduced from 5 days to 2.3 days.  
- 70% of tickets resolved within 2 days (up from 20%).  

---

## Step 5: Control

### Control Plan
- Weekly monitoring of resolution time using dashboards (Tableau or Excel).  
- Monthly review meeting with Help Desk team.  
- Documentation updated in IT Service Guidelines.  

### Sustainability
- Assigned a process owner to ensure the new system continues to be used.  

---

## Outcome
- Reduced ticket backlog by 60%.  
- Improved student and staff satisfaction (measured by post-resolution survey).  
- IT Help Desk efficiency increased without hiring extra staff.
